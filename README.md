# OCL
OneClickLink

basically I thought it would be cool if I had a tool to open all the daily tabs I need bc otherwise I have to open all of them manually, which leads to me not wanting to open all of them thus I never get work done.

like instead of opening 5 different urls I just have to go to this one

for the first time you visit you can enter all of the links and then from then on it will open them for you

to modify them you just go to /settings or smth
